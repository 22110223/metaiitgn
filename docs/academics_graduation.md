**1. Graduation Norms for B.Tech. Program:**

      **(Applicable for students admitted from AY 2022-23)** 

- To graduate from a programme, a student must complete the requisite minimum courses for the BTech degree, you must enrol in a programme and earn 169–175 credits based on the organisational guidelines each subject specifies.


- **One credit** is typically equal to **forty hours of study load** (mind-space time) from a student, therefore for a four-credit course, the student is required to complete 160 hours of study load during the semester, including contact hours.


- All BTech students must complete **32 credits** of coursework in the **humanities and** **social sciences,** including the two writing courses **HS 191: Introduction to Writing I and HS 192: Introduction to Writing II, which are both required and are of 2 credits**


- The Humanities and Social Sciences courses that are required for undergraduate students in addition to the Writing courses are **Economics (4 credits)**, **Introduction** **to** **Philosophy (4 credits), and World Civilizations and Cultures (4 credits).** Baskets of courses may be made available in the future as a replacement to the Humanities and Social Sciences courses that are currently required. The remaining **16 credits** will be made up of **4 credits worth of electives in the humanities, social sciences, or management worth of general education courses from a basket.** Courses on cultural expression, performing arts, theatre, fine arts, sports, and other topics may be included in the **General Education (GE) Basket.** The courses included in the General Education Basket that are required (up to 4 credits) will only receive a **Pass/Fail** grade rather than a standard letter grade. If a student doesn't pass the Foundation Program, they can still graduate if they pass an additional **4 credits of GE courses**

_( Note: Credit for courses offered under the General Education Basket cannot be counted towards the graduation requirements for students who are admitted before 2022-23.)_

- The **Science Basket,** which includes classes in chemistry, cognitive science, earth sciences, and physics, must be completed by all students for a total of **8 credits.** One of the two courses that a student must successfully finish may be specified by the parent discipline of the student. The courses that are included in the science basket will occasionally be updated. All students must additionally take an **additional 8 credits of electives in basic science,** which can include courses from the science basket.


- All undergraduate students must take a **project course i**n order to gain research experience during their undergraduate program. After the first year of their undergraduate program, the student is able to complete an open project course **(4 credits)** in the field or discipline of their choice. Under the auspices of IIEC, The institute will also look into the possibilities of developing open project courses on entrepreneurship. The IITGN Research Park may potentially offer this project-based learning course in association with business partners.


- All undergraduate students are required to take three mathematics courses: **MA 103: Calculus of Single Variable & Linear Algebra (4 credits), MA 104: Ordinary Differential Equations (2 credits), and MA 203: Numerical Methods (2 credits).** Additionally, a student must finish 2 credits of coursework from the Mathematics Basket, which could include courses on partial differential equations, complex analysis, integral transform, optimisation theory, and calculus of several variables, to mention a few. The student's parent discipline may specify the course from the mathematics basket they want them to take. It is intended for all mathematics courses to be taught in an active learning environment, making extensive use of visual learning aids, programming assignments, etc.


- Students are free to sign up for **project courses** in addition to the **Open Project** Course either under their parent's control or not. These project courses may be taken **at Level 2 (XX- 299), Level 3 (XX- 399), or Level 4 (XX- 499) for a maximum of 16 credits** can be used to fulfil the criteria for graduation.
