	1. Requirements:
		<ol type="A">
  		<li>At least **20 additional credits** specified by that discipline/focus area group over and above base programme requirements</li>
  		<li>**Two open electives** from the base programme, if qualify, may count towards additional credit requirement</li>
		</ol>
- **For all other students**:
	1. Requirements:
		<ol type="A">
  		<li>At least **20 additional credits** from the same discipline over and above base requirements</li>
  		<li>**One open elective** from the base programme, if qualify, may count towards additional credit requirement</li>
		</ol>
- Students will initially take admission in BTech programme and will generally register for the minimum requirements of this base level programme.
- The students can keep collecting credits by successfully completing different courses during their stay by following their own planned academic path and aspirations in mind. 
- The students would not need to explicitly mention the type of elective and the expected outcome during the registration to a course.
- In addition, it is possible that a course which is not generally offered by that particular discipline but helps the students deepen their understanding in the respective discipline, may also be considered for Honors with the approval of the DPC and the DOAA.

At the time of graduation, the students may claim their basic degree of B.Tech or B.Tech with Minor(s) based on the collected credits.
