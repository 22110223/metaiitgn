# Academic Discussion Hours (ADH)
    
These informal course-wise help sessions are conducted by senior students with good scores and are designed to create a tutorial-like platform for students to ask as many doubts as they want freely. Students can discuss technical details and problem-solving skills or seek general guidance related to the course. The primary focus is to assist first and second-year students who are facing challenges in particular courses.Â 

They usually take place after dinner from 9 pm to 11 pm (though the timing may extend based on the peer tutor) and involve a small group of peer tutors, comprising senior students who have excelled in that course. A faculty member oversees the coordination of the sessions, including identifying the specific course, selecting senior student tutors, and regularly discussing progress with them.

Overall, these informal help sessions serve as a valuable resource, fostering a collaborative learning environment and promoting the academic growth of students at IIT Gandhinagar.
