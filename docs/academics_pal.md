## **Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL)**
The Peer-Assisted Learning is a programme undertaken by the **Student Academic Council (SAC)** that aims to help students adapt to English as the primary mode of instruction. The program facilitates the students' interaction with mentors from the sophomore, junior and senior years, some of whom have had similar experiences in their freshman year. The mentors help identify other resources like the Academic Discussion Hours that cater to mentee-specific issues. In addition to that, the programme also conducts Grammar Workshops and interaction sessions with the faculty for the PAL mentees.
