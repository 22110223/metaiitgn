# Dual Majors

IIT Gandhinagar provides the opportunity to its students enrolled in the B.Tech programme to opt for a Dual-Major Programme during their course of study to earn an additional B.Tech degree in a second branch of their choice.

For example, a student in Mechanical Engineering, also referred to as parent discipline, could opt for a second B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.

**Essential Features**:

- B.Tech Students may apply for the programme any time after the successful completion of **three semesters**.
- Merit-based allocation with the following CPI requirements:
	1. **CPI â‰¥ 6.50**
	2. **No fail grade** (F or E)
- The maximum number of students permitted to pursue a second major in a discipline cannot exceed
	1. **10 seats** or,
	2. **20% of the sanctioned strength of that discipline**,
	whichever is greater.
- In order to graduate with Dual Majors, a student has to complete compulsory courses of both the disciplines (no need to repeat common courses) within at most **12 semesters**. In addition to this, the minimum credit requirement involving discipline specific electives of their parent discipline must also be fulfilled.
- Scheduling of the courses is at the discretion of the student, though a certain extent of relaxation on fulfilling credit requirements related to open electives will be provided.
- Students enrolled in Dual Majors programme may opt to exit out of the programme and join their parent discipline at any point of time after enrollment.

  
On successful completion of all the requirements, the student will be awarded B.Tech degree mentioning both majors with the name of admitting discipline being mentioned first and the discipline of the second major will follow.
