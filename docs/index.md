## Why does this exist?

MetaIITGandhinagar aspires to be a centralized hub and interactive platform created specifically for IIT Gandhinagar students. Drawing inspiration from MetaKGP, our platform is a vast and organized repository of everything IITGN-related. From academics, departments, campus amenities, to student groups, we aim to provide a well-rounded view of life and studies at IITGN, making it a personalized Wikipedia for your needs.

Whether you are a first-year student charting your academic journey, a final-year student seeking research advice, or just someone interested in extracurricular activities, MetaIITGandhinagar has you covered. We host a wide array of articles, guides, and firsthand accounts from your peers. More than a passive information resource, it's a user-driven platform inviting your active engagement. Share your insights and experiences, contributing to this evolving knowledge reservoir that benefits everyone at IITGN.

MetaIITGandhinagar is by design, entirely open-source, built on MkDocs with a customized material theme, with its contents sourced from students across our community. We welcome contributions from everyone, and you can find out more about how to contribute [here](https://www.github.com).
