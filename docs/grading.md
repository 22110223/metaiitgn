## **Grading System at IITGN**
The Academic Office offers the following grades:


*   **A+ (11/10)**
*   **A (10/10)**
*   **A- (9/10)**
*   **B (8/10)**
*   **B- (7/10)**
*   **C (6/10)**
*   **C- (5/10)**
*   **D (4/10)**
*   **E**
*   **F (Fail Grade)**
*   **I (Incomplete Grade)**
*   **P (Pass Grade)**

Few insights into the assignment of these grades:


1.   An **A+ (11/10)** grade is usually assigned to one or two students who have excelled way beyond their peers in a particular course. It is to the discretion of the course instructor to have/not to have an **A+** grade for their course.
2.  The **E** is assigned in case of below-par performance in a course.
3.  The infamous **F/Fail** grade is assigned in the scenarios when the student is caught in an unethical malpractice that violates the IITGN code of conduct or it may even be imposed for poor performance in a course.
4.  Again to the discretion of the instructor, the **E** may hold a weightage of **(3/10)** or **(2/10)** and the for certain, the **F** amounts to **(0/10)**
5. The **I (Incomplete)**, is assigned in case the student fails to complete the said lecture/lab credits for the course time. **I** is quite common to be assigned in the **Foundation Programme (FP)**, wherein students fail to attend enough foundation sessions. Once assigned, the student usually has to go through a social service hour programme to withdraw the grade.
6. There are few courses, under the **General Education (GE)** basket and **Physical Education (PE)**, that amount to a *no-numbered grade*: such courses are termed as **Pass-Fail** courses.
7. Course instructors usually follow either of the two policies - *Relative* or *Absolute* for grade assignment. Following are discussed below

## **Course Grading Policy**
Although there is no well defined procedure that all instructors follow, the proposed system yet captures most of the essence.
### **Relative Grading System**
The system that most students favour!

| Score | Grade |
| :---:   | :---:   |
| **μ + 9kσ/2**  | **A+ (11/10)**   |
| **μ + 7kσ/2**  | **A (10/10)**   |
| **μ + 5kσ/2**  | **A- (9/10)**   |
| **μ + 3kσ/2**  | **B (8/10)**   |
| **μ + kσ/2 to μ - kσ/2**  | **B- (7/10)**   |
| **μ - 3kσ/2**  | **C (6/10)**   |
| **μ - 5kσ/2**  | **C- (5/10)**   |
| **μ - 7kσ/2**  | **D (4/10)**   |
| **μ - 9kσ/2**  | **E (3 or 2/10)**   |
| **μ - 11kσ/2**  | **F (0/10)**   |

Here **k** is a constant that is decided by the course instructor. μ describes the mean of distribution of the marks as obtained by all the students taking that course, whereas the σ is the standard deviation of the same. The basis for this system is that the marks distribution has to form a Gaussian and within 'x' standard deviation from the mean (μ + xσ), the percentage of people having that particular score reduces significantly.

### **Absolute Grading**

| Score | Grade |
| :---:   | :---:   |
| **≥ 90 or 95**  | **A+ (11/10)**   |
| **85 - 90 or 95**  | **A (10/10)**   |
| **80 - 85**  | **A- (9/10)**   |
| **75 - 80**  | **B (8/10)**   |
| **70 - 75**  | **B- (7/10)**   |
| **65 - 70**  | **C (6/10)**   |
| **60 - 65**  | **C- (5/10)**   |
| **50 - 60**  | **D (4/10)**   |
| **35 or 45 - 50**  | **E (3 or 2/10)**   |
| **≤ 35 or 45**  | **F (0/10)**   |
