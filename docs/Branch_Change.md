# Branch Change:

The rules for branch change are as follows:

Students with a CPI (Cumulative Performance Index) of 9.50 or higher can change their branch without any restrictions. For other students, branch change will be permitted based on their merit determined by their respective CPI. Only students with a CPI of 6.50 or higher, and without any fail grades or backlogs, will be eligible to apply. Requests for branch change will be considered in the order of merit. For example, student S1 from branch A can request a change to branch B if the following conditions are met:

(a) The strength of branch B does not exceed 10% of the sanctioned strength for that branch.

(b) The number of students in branch A does not fall below 50% of the sanctioned strength.

(c) If another student transfers to branch A, the request of student S1 will be reconsidered, again in the order of merit, as long as condition (b) is not violated.

For example, if Computer Science and Engineering has 40 students to start with, it can have a total of 44 students post branch-change (a difference of 10%). Again, if there are 40 students in Mechanical Engineering, a total of 20 students can change out of the branch (i.e, a difference of 50%). 

Branch transfers can only be made once at the beginning of the second academic year. No applications for branch change will be accepted during subsequent academic years.

# Discipline change: 

## BTech to MTech:

Students pursuing BTech at IIT Gandhinagar, starting from 2013 or later, can apply for a dual degree program. They can apply for this program after completing four semesters, but no later than the end of six semesters. To be eligible, students must have achieved a minimum CPI (Cumulative Performance Index) of 6.0 out of 10 at the time of application. They are allowed to apply to disciplines other than their current BTech program, provided those disciplines offer a regular MTech program and they meet the eligibility criteria set by each discipline. Each discipline will communicate the specific eligibility criteria in advance, outlining the requirements for admission to the dual degree program. The final decision on the conversion to the dual degree program will be made by a selection committee established within the discipline the student wishes to pursue their MTech studies in.

## MTech to BTech or MTech: 

Students admitted to the BTech-MTech dual degree programs through direct admission are eligible to request a change of program or branch. This change can be made once at the beginning of the second year and will follow the same policies as branch changes for BTech programs. The direct admission BTech-MTech dual degree programs are considered equivalent to a branch within a regular BTech program. For example, a student enrolled in the BTech-MTech Dual Degree in Computer Science and Engineering could switch to BTech in Chemical Engineering, BTech in Computer Science & Engineering, or another BTech-MTech Dual Degree program such as Electrical Engineering. Similarly, a student admitted to BTech in Chemical Engineering can also consider direct admission BTech-MTech Dual Degree programs as well as other branch change options within the regular BTech disciplines.
